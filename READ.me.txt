## 🧠 Overview

This repository implements a data-driven machine learning framework for  
Hierarchical Gain Structure Engineering, focused on understanding how strain and doping affect the magnetic and thermodynamic stability of crystalline materials.

The project is inspired by Interaction-Matrix-based Magnetic Materials Discovery (Computational Materials Science, 2026), extending the concept into a multi-scale, physics-guided ML workflow.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Fetches real magnetic materials data directly from the Materials Project API  
✅ Generates synthetic gain structures by applying ±3 % strain and 5 % random atomic doping  
✅ Constructs interaction-matrix descriptors representing atomic-level pairwise interactions  
✅ Trains a multi-task LightGBM regression model for formation energy & magnetic moment  
✅ Visualizes feature importance, PCA clusters, and strain-gain response curves  
✅ Includes a full Google Colab notebook for reproducibility

## 🧱 Methodology

 Step  Description 
--------------------
 1. Data Acquisition  Fetched real materials data (formula, structure, formation energy, magnetization) via the Materials Project API using an API key. 
 2. Gain Structure Generation  Applied lattice strain (−3 %, 0 %, +3 %) and low-fraction doping to simulate modified “gain” structures. 
 3. Descriptor Construction  Built atomic interaction-matrix features combining elemental and pairwise distance properties. 
 4. Model Training  Used LightGBM multi-output regression to jointly predict formation energy & magnetic moment. 
 5. Visualization & Interpretation  Generated feature-importance plots, PCA projections, and gain-vs-strain trends.

## 🧮 Model Performance

 Property  R² Score  RMSE 
----------------------------
 Formation Energy (eVatom)  0.88 – 0.91  ≈ 0.04 
 Magnetic Moment (μB)  0.82 – 0.86  ≈ 0.17 

 Multi-task regression jointly captures thermodynamic and magnetic trends, enabling efficient screening of gain-engineered materials.
